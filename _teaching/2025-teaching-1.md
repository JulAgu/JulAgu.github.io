This workshop aims to introduce third-year agricultural engineering students to the effective implementation of machine learning techniques for imputing missing values in hydrological data.

After an introductory overview to AI and ML, the main section focus on implementing machine learning algorithms for data imputation and evaluating the uncertainty associated with these methods. The workshop includes practical exercises using jupyter notebooks.

I gave this workshop as a guest lecturer in the hydrology course of Professor [Carlos Gonzales](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Gonzalez-Murillo).
