excerpt: Son Sagú is a family band with over 15 years of history. Dedicated to the Andean peasant folklore of Colombia’s central high plains, we specialize in [Carranga](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carranga). During the pandemic, we composed and recorded this original song, inspired by the landscapes and traditions of our parents’ and grandparents’ village.
