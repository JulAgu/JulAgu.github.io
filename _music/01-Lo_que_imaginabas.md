title: Lo que imaginabas - Input

excerpt: Input band was a fleeting alternative rock project in which I participated in mid 2019. It was a short but substantial band, and I'm proud of everything we did together. [Jorge Suarez](https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeSuarez66) and Jonathan Quevedo were the songwriters and minds behind the music. I participated mainly as intrumentalist and composing various bass lines. **Other song snippets are available on [the project's instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/input_band/)**.
