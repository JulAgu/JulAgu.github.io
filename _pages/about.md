I am a PhD student in applied computer science. My research focuses on **Hybrid Physical Models**.

I am affiliated to the research unit [UMR MIA](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/) (Mathématique et Informatique Appliquées), within team [EkINocs](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/ekinocs) (Expert Knowledge, INteractive modellINg and learnINg for understandINg and decisiOn makINg in dINamic Complexe Systems).

Given the industrial focus of my PhD, I implement part of my research as on-demand products within the agronomic service of [Agrial](https://www.agrial.com/en/).

A few words about the blog and the music section
------
**At the blog** you'll find some short articles where I explain Machine Learning concepts in my own way, I share ideas about the actual state of the field or I narrate some historical topic of learning that I find interesting. This blog is above all a personal exercise to encourage me to write texts and to consolidate the knowledge I am learning. **Although it is a personal blog, all the information comes from reliable sources.**

**At the music section**, just myself taking advantage of a small corner of the internet to share the passion that has accompanied me throughout my life. Here I share music of my own, of friends or of artists I follow.
