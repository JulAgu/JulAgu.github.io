I am a PhD student in applied computer science. My research focuses on **Hybrid Physical Models**.

I am affiliated to the research unit [UMR MIA](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/) (Mathématique et Informatique Appliquées), within team [EkINocs](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/ekinocs) (Expert Knowledge, INteractive modellINg and learnINg for understandINg and decisiOn makINg in dINamic Complexe Systems).

Given the industrial focus of my PhD, I implement part of my research as on-demand products within the agronomic service of [Agrial](https://www.agrial.com/en/).
