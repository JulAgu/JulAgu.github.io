I am a PhD student in Informatics - Machine Learning. My research focuses on **Hybrid Physical Models** and **Multi-agent simulations** with applications in agronomy and logistics. 

I am affiliated to the research unit [UMR MIA](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/) (Mathématique et Informatique Appliquées), within team [EkINocs](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/ekinocs) (Expert Knowledge, INteractive modellINg and learnINg for understandINg and decisiOn makINg in dINamic Complexe Systems). My research is conducted under the supervision of [Cristina Manfredotti](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/cristina-manfredotti), with co-advisors [Vincent Guigue](https://vguigue.github.io/) and [Evelyne Lutton](http://evelyne.lutton.free.fr/).

Given the industrial focus of my PhD, I implement part of my research as on-demand products within the agronomic service of [Agrial](https://www.agrial.com/en/).
